I'm getting ready to consider 2k (not 4k) for a main monitor 

But, I don't want to spend too much

Have you tried out 2k? Is it noticeably better?

Bob44, 7:27 PM
I have not.

But its gonna be awhile before 4k

Cause gaming still not there

7:28 PM
Yeah. Gpus are getting good, but increasing res and hz brings them back down to mediocre

Bob44, 7:28 PM
Yeah, but 4k can't even have 144hz yet

And it stresses out the VC more than 1080p or 2k
